      <h2>Proposition: Black Americans Are Disproportionately Unfairly Treated By Police</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../../images/project2-for-propositon.png" alt="Plot of Total Substantiated Claims By Ethnicity" />
          <figcaption>Black Complainants Constitute A Large Majority of Total Substantiated Claims</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The x-axis ends at the largest bar length, in order to maximize the visual differences in length between the bars.
            This works better than extending the x-axis because it "zooms in" on the bars, making it easier for viewers to compare bars. 
            I considered various ranges of x but settled on this because the bars are the largest at this range. Score: 1
          </li>
          <li>
            Gridlines were added to more easily visually compare bar length. Initially, I didn't have gridlines, but I added them because it gives
            viewers a sense of scale and bar size. Viewers can break down bar lengths into even pieces using the gridlines, enabling easier visual
            comparisons. Score: 2
          </li>
          <li>
            The bars are sorted in descending order to make disparities between groups easier to visualize and to understand which ethnicities file more claims.
            Initially, I didn't sort the bars, but I settled on sorting the bars by length in descending order so that it becomes easy to identify that black complainants
            lead by a large margin in total substantiated claims, with over 2 times more substantiated claims than the next highest group (Hispanics). The descending
            order also gives viewers a visual order of the ethnicities, where Black Complainants lead, then Hispanic Complainants, then White Complainants, etc.  Score: 1
          </li>
          <li>
            Each ethnicity has a distinct and consistent color (for both plots) to make it easier to identify ethnicities. Initially, I 
            used distinct coloring, but I didn't make the coloring consistent. So for any plot, one ethnicity might be blue in one plot and
            red in another plot. I created a palette to consistently color each ethnicity so that viewers could just look for colors to recognize an ethnicity instead
            of having to constantly check the legend to see which ethnicity is which color. Score: 2
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../../images/project2-against-proposition.png" alt="Plot of Average Substantiation Rate By Ethnicity" />
          <figcaption>All Ethnicities Display Similar Substantiation Rates</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The y-axis goes from 0 to 1 and has a lot of white space in order to minimize the visual differences between the bars.
            Initially, the y-axis only went from 0 to 0.4. At this range of y, the bars appeared somewhat close in height, but the
            differences were much more obvious. I settled on 1 as the high end of the range because a percent higher than 1 doesn't
            make sense. Additionally, at this level, the bars appeared relatively similar in height or at least similar enough to claim that
            the substantiation rates were close for all ethnicities. Score: -2
          </li>
          <li>
            Each ethnicity has a distinct and consistent color (for both plots) for easy identification and visual clarity. Instead of
            confusing viewers by using different colors (for each ethnicity) in this plot than the For Proposition plot, I settled on using a
            palette to give each ethnicity a consistent color. Score: 2
          </li>
          <li>
            The bars are not organized in any order, making visual comparisons of bars (especially bars that aren't next to each other)
            more difficult. I considered sorting them, but realized that this would help viewers notice small differences in bar heights and 
            enable them to identify the ordering, which in turn would remove some of the guesswork with estimating bar height differences.
            If I told the viewers the bars were sorted, then they would be able to tell which bar is greater than another due to the sorted ordering. Score: -0.5
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          For both the Against and For plots, I would say that the design process was generally straightforward. I was able to apply a lot of the
          visual encoding guidelines from class to ensure that the plots were easy to understand for viewers. For example, consistent, discrete color
          encodings for variables is something that I made sure to apply in both of my plots to increase readability. I didn't want to blatantly confuse 
          viewers by changing the colors of the ethnicities between plots. What I found challenging in this assignment was being subtly deceptive without
          misrepresenting the data. For example, in the For Proposition plot, setting the right x-axis range to essentially "zoom in" and highlight the difference in total Black
          Complainant Claims vs. all other Complainant Claims was simple. On the other hand, setting the y-axis in the Against plot was more challenging because
          it took some adjusting to see at what point I felt like the differences between the bar heights was being masked/hidden. I could have easily chosen
          the y-axis to extend to 10, in which case every bar would look very small, however this would defeat the purpose of a visualization. It
          was surprising to me that it felt difficult to find that balance where the visualization deceptively hid trends while not being obvious to viewers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would define an ethical analysis and visualization as a commitment to fairly represent data without modifying it to display trends
          that are not seen in the data. In my For plot, I embodied ethical visualization by using clear and distinct color encodings for each ethnicity,
          gridlines for easier visual bar length comparisons, and organizing the bars by length to help viewers make comparisons and gain an
          understanding of the ordering. On the other hand, I would say I did not embody ethical visualization in my Against plot by not organizing the
          bars and extending the y-axis to a length that made the bar lengths appear more similar and not adding gridlines to make visual comparisons
          between bars more difficult. In that vain, I would say that "acceptable" persuasion are design choices that improve the clarity and
          readability of the plot, through methods such as clear color encoding and labeling as well as x and y axes that are reasonably bounded.
          On the other hand, "misleading" persuasion are design choices that attempt to hide or minimize differences and trends in a visualization, such
          as using misleading axes or using similar colors/color gradients.
